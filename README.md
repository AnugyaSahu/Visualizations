# Visualizations
Visualizations are a crucial aspect of data analysis and communication. They help to understand complex data, identify patterns, and convey insights effectively. Matplotlib and Seaborn are two powerful libraries in Python that are widely used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
